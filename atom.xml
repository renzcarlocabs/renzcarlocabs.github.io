    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h3>Started from scratch</h3>

<p>When I started having my training, I was asked to recreate a website just by looking from the screenshots provided. Below are the screenshots provided to me. Have a look for yourself.

<p>And here are the screenshots when I tried to replicate it.

<p>To be quite honest, the design or the layout of the page, the alignment of certain elements, images and text took more time that when I was coding for the slider. I never was really design oriented hahaha! So anyway please check out my next blog, it will be about the documentation for the code of the slider. Please tune in :)</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h3>New to the Process!</h3>

<p>Well this is my very first blog, and although I have clearly no idea why it worked sinced all I&rsquo;ve done is that I&rsquo;ve followed the instructions located in <a href = "octopress.org">octopress.org</a>, it seems that I have managed to somehow, create a simple blog.</p>

<h3>Time Management</h3>

<p>I was given this task at around 9:30 in the morning and only seem to work it out at almost 4:00 in the afternoon. Seriously, I have got to get my groove on. Since my skills and abilities are used to Windows OS. I still am really trying to fit in with the Linux OS. I need to fit in, and fast if I really want to learn more.</p>

<h3>What I&rsquo;ve Learned so far</h3>

<p>I know that there are more things to learn in the command line other that directory manipulation, sudo apt-get install etc. But I think from what I know in the command line so far, it will get me through the basics of this operating system. Also I have just finished on the activity I&rsquo;ve been working, the re-creation of a website with a very simple slider and paginator with play and pause buttons which I will be featuring in the next blog I&rsquo;ll be doing. And obviously, I&rsquo;ve learned how to create a simple blog, even though this is only a basic blog, I will study on how to make it more lively.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h3>The Intern</h3>

<p>There comes a point in our life that we have to start from the bottom in order to be at the top. Like gamers, you can&rsquo;t be a pro if you hadn&rsquo;t been a beginner. That&rsquo;s the reason on why I have branded myself the intern hahaha! Well asides from the fact that I will only have my OJT experience once, it really adds some finesse to me.</p>
